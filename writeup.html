        -The description with storyboards from part 1.
            Describe the data domain and storyboard interactive visualization techniques you will use.
            Start either by choosing a data domain or choosing the interactive visualization techniques you will implement. Think about why the domain and the techniques are a good match for one another. Then write a description of data domain and the interactive visualization application you will build. The description should include a storyboard of the interface/displays you will create. Be sure to explain the features of your application. Most importantly you should explain why the interaction techniques you will implement will be effective in the context of your data domain. The goal of this exercise is to think through the various concerns that go into the software implementation. This is why it is important that you perform this task first, before actually building the software.
                    -A brief description of your final interactive visualization application.
        
        -An explanation of changes between the storyboard and the final implementation.
        
        -The bundled source code for your application, uploaded as a webpage or file (either a .zip or .tar.gz archive). Please ensure that the software submitted is in working order. If any special instructions are needed for building or running your software, please provide them.
        
        -Finally, please include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application? What aspects took the most time?
