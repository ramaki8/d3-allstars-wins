                        I want to investigate if the number of all stars on a baseball team and how well that team does in the regular season have any correlation. I have decided to use a mouseover interaction and a either a zooming or brushing interaction for this data. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think that the mouseover interaction is good for this data because there will be a lot of information for each data point. I do not want to overload the visualization with information, but I want users to be able to see that information, such as the team's name and the number of wins, if desired.

                            When the user hovers over a data point, they can see various information about that point. When they move their mouse off the point, the information disappears.

                            When the user wants to zoom in on a certain area, they can click and drag the mouse to select the desired range of x values. This area will be highlighted in some way while dragging so that the user knows what they have selected.

                            Once the user finishes selecting the area the want to zoom in on, they can release the mouse button and the graph will dynamically adjust the y axis so that the points will spread out from each other.

                    <h4>
                        Description of final interactive visualization application
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        My final visualization is a scatterplot that plots the wins and the number of allstars for all MLB teams from the year 2000 to 2010. There is a separate point for each team for each year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the interactive features on my plot is hover tooltips for each of the points that tell the year of the data, the team, and the number of wins they had that year. When hovering over a point, it also darkens in color so that it is more evident what data point you are hovering over.
                        </br>
                        Another interactive feature is brushing. When the user clicks and drags the mouse over a part of the plot, that part is highlighted. Once the user releases the mouse button, the plot readjusts its y axis to be the highlighted area and the data points readjust accordingly. After brushing, a button appears to allow the user to reset the axis to its original size.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Changes between the storyboard and the final implementation
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        One change is that instead of graphing win percentage on the y axis, I graphed the number of wins. This is because practically, both mean the same thing since every team plays the same number of games every season. Number of wins in a season seems to be more fequently used than season-long win percentage in baseball.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Development Process
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I spent about 8 hours developing my application. The things that took the most time were figuring out the brushing process and aligning everything how I wanted it. It also took a while to dubug some issues I was having with the brushing and another issue I had with fetching the data. Overall this was a really informative process and I learned a lot about d3 and some different interactive visualization techniques.
